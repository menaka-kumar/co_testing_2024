This folder is for data collected from July-August 2024 on CO sensors tested in the environmental test chamber in EPA RTP D566A conducted by NSSC Menaka Kumar for Amara Holder. The folders here contain:

"Analyzed" folder: Final plots of the data
"Code" folder: python code to analyze and plot the chamber and sensor data from the CO testing
"Data" folder: .csv and .txt files of both the chamber and sensor data for all the tests in all the sensor groups.
"Results" folder: contain .pptx presentations of the data from each group


Overall, there were 3 groups of sensors tests. The successful sensors in each group were:
Group 1: BlueSkys
Group 2: LASCARS, VAMMS, and Canarys
Group 3: QuantAQs

4 tests were done on the sensors. Test 1 being a concentration ramp from 0-30ppm in 5ppm increments for group 1 and 2 and, for group 3, a concentration ramp from 0-10ppm in 2ppm increments. Test 2 was the effect of relative humidity and temperature at 5ppm for group 1 and 2 and, for group 3, at 2ppm. The T values of interest were 25 and 35C and the RH values of interest were 30, 50, 70% (These values were limited by what the chamber could do before the repairs due to the chamber not being able to control dehumidification as it should). Test 3 is similar to test 2 but does at 10ppm for group 1 and 2, and for group 3, at 8ppm. Test 4 is a repeat of test 1.
