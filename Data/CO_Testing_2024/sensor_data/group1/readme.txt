Bluesky Folder: Placed 3 bluesky sensors in the chamber. For the data in group 1, the data is organized in folders by the sensor ID. Each sensor ID folder has a few files that all together contain tests 1-4 for that sensor ID.

Lascar Folder: Placed 4 Lascars in the chamber. The lascar sensors actually died before the tests started so the data is not useful.

QuantAQ Folder: Placed 3 quantaq sensors in the chamber. For the quantaq sensors, each of the sensors maxed out at 10-12ppm so on the dashboard I would see a message that said that the CO sensor "needs attention". And while the sensor was in this state it would not record data. So this data is not very useful, except for the data in test 2. But regardless, group 3 is a repeat of the QuantAQ sensors but done at 0-10ppm to avoid the CO sensor from stopping its data collection. Data files are in the format "test[test number]_group[group numbers]_MOD-[sensor ID number]_[time averaging].csv".
