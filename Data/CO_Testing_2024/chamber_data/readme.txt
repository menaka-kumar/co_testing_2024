The files in this folder are data obtained from the environmental test chamber in EPA RTP D566A. The data (CO, RH and T) was obtained using Envidas Reporter (except for the data file in group 3 test 2 where the T and RH values were downloaded from the ESPEC webpage).

Files are in the format test[test #]_group[sensor group #]_[time average]min.csv. For example, "test1_group1_1min.csv" is a file for the first group of sensors, the first concentration ramp, and at 1 min time averaging. The data taken from the ESPEC webpage is test2_group3_ESPEC_1min.
