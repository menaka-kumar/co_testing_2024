Files are in the format test[test #]_group[sensor group #]_[time average]min.csv. For example, "test1_group1_1min.csv" is a file for the first group of sensors, the first concentration ramp, and at 1 min time averaging.

For some reason, in group 3 test 2 the Envidas software did not record the RH and T values so I had to download the RH and T data from the ESPEC webpage. The file for that is "test2_group3_ESPEC_1min.csv". "test2_group3_1min.csv" just contains data of the CO concentration levels during that test.
